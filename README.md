This repository contains a simple JavaScript example that demonstrates how null values can cause errors if not handled correctly.  The `foo` function adds two numbers but returns `null` if either input is `null`. This is often undesirable and can lead to unexpected behavior in larger applications. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a more robust implementation that handles null values more gracefully.
